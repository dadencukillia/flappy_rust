# flappy_rust
Copy of Flappy Bird with Ferris crab made in Rust programming language

## Library and idea
Made on library [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) (version 0.9.3).

The idea for the graphics and gameplay was taken from YouTube when I was looking for a video about the ggez library. Youtuber's Github project: [AndrewJakubowicz - Flappy Crabby](https://github.com/AndrewJakubowicz/ggezFlappyCrabby).

## Cargo commands
`cargo run` to play in the game,<br>
`cargo build` to build the game,<br>
`cargo build -release` to build the game in release mode;

## Gameplay
The only goal is to jump so as not to hit the pillars.

To jump, just press the `Space` button. If you lost and want to start the game from the beginning, then press the `R` button.
